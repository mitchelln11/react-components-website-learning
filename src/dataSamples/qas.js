        question : "Where did the term \"Undermine\" come from?",
        answer : "When the Turks and the Byzantine were fighting for Constantinople, now Istanbul, the Turks had to find a way to get past the stone walls after all other methods of bombardment failed. They opted to send miners under the walls, hence undermine, in an attempt to destabilize the wall."

        question : "Where Did the term \"Black-Balled\" come from",
        answer : "During the American civil war, a wooden box existed as almost a ballot dropbox. When something came to a vote, such as a promotion or demotion, the effected officer or soldier would hold this wooden box from a wooden handle over their shoulder. The voters walked behind and dropped either a white or a black ball into a hole that dropped into the box. The white ball meant the soldier or officer voting approved. If the voting officer or soldier disapproved, they would drop the black ball in. If the effected soldier or officer received 3 black balls, the vote or promotion failed leaving the soldier or officer none the wiser as to who black-balled them."

        question : "Why do people call something of poor quality \"Shoddy\"?",
        answer : "In the American civil war, President Abraham Lincoln needed to clothe an entire Army. The outlook was that the war would be over by Christmas, so the government looked for a cheap option. They found a textile owner by the name of \"William Shoddy\" who won the contract to clothe the entire Northern Army. The cheaply-made clothes withered away on marches and in the battlefields in the first several months of the war. The term for the quality of these uniforms deservedly earned the nickname \"Shoddy craftsmanship\", aimed at the owner of the textile company. His company soon went under."
